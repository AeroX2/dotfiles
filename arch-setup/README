#Installation
Place i3lock-custom, i3lock-custom-n and i3lock-files in /usr/bin/
Now either place the xss-lock command in your autostart file or place the autostart/*.desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart
i3 doesn't support *.desktop file in xdg so install dex and add "exec dex -ae i3" to your i3 config file
